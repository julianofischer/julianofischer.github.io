title: Notes on traces, part 1

Hi all, how are you?
I dedicate this post to introductory aspects of using traces.

As we know, the use of simulation is a try to bypass the lack of real test environments or testbeds. Whenever simulations are required, there are an effort by researchers to produce scenarios increasingly realistic. Aiming helping other researchers, some of our research colleagues make available data from real deployments. And it really helps. 

Also in this context, I could not fail to mention the [Crawdad Project](http://crawdad.org/). As described on project's home page, the Crawdad Project is "*the Community Resource for Archiving Wireless Data At Dartmouth, a wireless network data resource for the research community*". Crawdad provides a large number of wireless networks trace data of different kind as **DTN**, MANET, RFID, WiMax, and other. Crawdad is amazing and very helpful! The numbers speak for themselves: at June, there are over 7,600 Crawdad users from 108 different countries.

An increasing number of papers are using data traces downloaded from Crawdad and the use of these real data traces is increasingly seen as a good aspect of papers involving simulation. Why are you wasting time? Visit now the project page and search for data which can help you in your research.

In the next posts, I will introduce some data traces, starting with the largely used *Rollernet*.

Thanks for your attention!
