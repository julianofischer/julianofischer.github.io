## About

This blog is intended to share information about Delay and Disruption Tolerant Networking and [Opportunistic Network Simulator](http://www.netlab.tkk.fi/tutkimus/dtn/theone/)(theONE).
I also intend to talk about my finds using Jekyll, Flask, Django and others.

I ask the readers in advance to excuse me about possible grammar errors. I hope to improve my English skill.

If you have free time, I would appreciate receive feedback at my [github repository](https://github.com/julianofischer/julianofischer.github.io). You can create issues or pull requests to help me! =)
