## About

This blog is intended to share information about Delay-Tolerant Networking and [theONE](http://www.netlab.tkk.fi/tutkimus/dtn/theone/) simulator.

I ask the readers in advance to excuse me about possible grammar errors. I hope to improve my English skill.

If you had free time, I would appreciate receive feedback at my [github repository](https://github.com/julianofischer/julianofischer.github.io). You can create issues or pull requests to help me! =)
